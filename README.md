# Hi there 👋, I'm Malak  

🖥️ **Software Engineer (frontend-focused)** with 3 years of experience building performant and SEO-friendly web applications using Angular.  

🌌 Currently pursuing a **Master’s in Smart & Secure Computer Engineering Systems** . 

🔬 Engaged in **research on molecular isotopes (CO₂, OH, …)** that contribute to understanding cosmic phenomena.  

📖 Practicing **storytelling between commits**, where curiosity meets code.  


I enjoy bridging **software engineering** with **scientific exploration**, always learning across disciplines and applying those insights in practical ways. My work reflects consistency, attention to detail, and a passion for exploring the unknown — whether in codebases or in the stars.
